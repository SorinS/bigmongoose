# bignum

Arbitrary-precision integers and constant-time arithmetic for the Goose
language, written in Goose: a foundation for cryptography.

- **`bignum`**: `BigInt`, signed integers of any size. Arithmetic,
  truncating and floor division, number theory, two's-complement bit
  operations, text in bases 2–36, and bytes. Variable-time, so never use it
  on secrets.
- **`bignum.ct`**: constant-time building blocks over fixed-width limb
  slices (masks, select, swap, compare, modular add/sub, small moduli,
  exact division).
- **`bignum.mont`**: constant-time Montgomery arithmetic for an odd modulus
  (multiply, exponentiate, reduce).
- **`bignum.x25519`**: X25519 Diffie-Hellman (RFC 7748), constant time.
- **`bignum.ec`**: P-224, P-256, P-384 and P-521: ECDH and deterministic ECDSA
  (RFC 6979), constant time.
- **`bignum.ed25519`**: Ed25519 signatures (RFC 8032), with Ed25519ctx and
  Ed25519ph; constant-time signing.
- **`bignum.mlkem`**: ML-KEM-512/768/1024 (FIPS 203), post-quantum key
  encapsulation, constant time.
- **`bignum.mldsa`**: ML-DSA-44/65/87 (FIPS 204), post-quantum signatures,
  hedged or deterministic, with contexts and external mu; constant time.
- **`bignum.hpke`**: HPKE (RFC 9180), all four modes, with DHKEM over
  P-256/384/521 and X25519, ML-KEM and the ML-KEM hybrids (X-Wing among
  them), HKDF and SHAKE KDFs, AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305 and export-only.
- **`bignum.rsa`**: RSA (RFC 8017): key generation, PKCS #1 v1.5 and PSS
  signatures, OAEP and PKCS #1 v1.5 encryption; everything that touches a
  private key (the private operation, loading, generating) in constant
  time.
- **`bignum.dsa`**: DSA (FIPS 186-4), for legacy keys: parameters, keys,
  random-nonce and deterministic (RFC 6979) signatures; constant-time
  keys, nonces and signing.
- **`bignum.ffdh`**: finite-field Diffie-Hellman over RFC 3526's MODP
  groups 14, 15 and 16 (2048, 3072 and 4096 bits), as SSH uses them: keys,
  the peer value's range check, and the shared secret, the secret exponent
  raised in constant time. A secret exponent is at least 224 bits (NIST SP
  800-56A, RFC 7919 §5.2).
- **`bignum.aes`**: AES-128/192/256 and CTR mode, bitsliced, constant time.
- **`bignum.gcm`**: AES-GCM authenticated encryption, constant time.
- **`bignum.modes`**: CBC, CFB, OFB and CTR over any of the block ciphers,
  XTS over 16-byte ones, and PKCS #7 padding.
- **`bignum.des`**: DES and triple DES, for legacy data.
- **`bignum.rc4`**: RC4, for legacy protocols only.
- **`bignum.blowfish`**, **`bignum.cast5`**, **`bignum.twofish`**,
  **`bignum.tea`** (TEA and XTEA), **`bignum.rc2`**: the legacy block
  ciphers of Go's x/crypto (and RC2 from its PKCS #12 decoder), each
  usable with `bignum.modes`. Table-driven, so not constant time.
- **`bignum.salsa20`**: Salsa20, XSalsa20 and HSalsa20.
- **`bignum.nacl`**: NaCl secretbox, box (and sealed anonymous boxes),
  sign and auth, as Go's x/crypto/nacl.

- **`bignum.sha512`**: SHA-512, SHA-384, SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256.
- **`bignum.sha1`**: SHA-1, for what still needs it.
- **`bignum.sha3`**: SHA3-224/256/384/512, SHAKE128/256 and cSHAKE.
- **`bignum.md4`**, **`bignum.ripemd160`**: MD4 and RIPEMD-160, for the
  formats that still carry them.
- **`bignum.md5`**: MD5, for what still needs it.
- **`bignum.blake2`**: BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s, keyed or not, and the BLAKE2Xb and
  BLAKE2Xs XOFs.
- **`bignum.hmac`**: one-shot hashing, HMAC, HKDF and MGF1 over any of them.
- **`bignum.kdf`**: PBKDF2 and scrypt.
- **`bignum.bcrypt`**: bcrypt password hashes, as Go's x/crypto/bcrypt, and
  bcrypt_pbkdf (OpenBSD's KDF for OpenSSH's encrypted keys).
- **`bignum.argon2`**: Argon2id, Argon2i and Argon2d (RFC 9106).
- **`bignum.entropy`**: random bytes from the OS (`getentropy`), for keys.

## Layer 1: `BigInt`

`struct BigInt { neg: bool, mag: u32[>..] }` is a sign and 32-bit limbs,
least significant first, always normalized: no leading zero limbs, and zero
is never negative. Limb products are taken in `u64`.

| Group | Functions |
|---|---|
| Make and convert | `zero` `one` `big(i64)` `from_u64` `to_i64 -> i64, bool` `to_u64` `to_f64` |
| Inspect | `is_zero` `is_neg` `is_odd` `is_even` `sign` `bit_len` `test_bit` |
| Compare | `cmp` `eq` `ne` `lt` `le` `gt` `ge` `cmp_i64` |
| Arithmetic | `add` `sub` `mul` `sqr` `neg` `abs` `pow(a, u64)` |
| Division | `divmod` `div` `rem` (truncating, like C); `divmod_floor` `div_floor` `mod_floor` (floor, like Python); zero divisor aborts |
| Number theory | `gcd` `lcm` `ext_gcd -> g, x, y` `modinv -> inv, bool` `modpow` `isqrt` |
| Bits | `shl` `shr` `bit_and` `bit_or` `bit_xor` `bit_not`; negatives as infinite two's complement, so `shr` rounds down |
| Text | `parse(s, base = 10) -> BigInt, bool` (sign, `0x` in base 16), `to_str(a, base = 10)`, `to_hex`, `format_base(out, a, base)` |
| Bytes | `from_bytes_be/le`, `to_bytes_be/le(a, width)` |
| In place | `add_to` `sub_from` `add_i64_to` `mul_to` `mod_to` `mul_add_small_to` `div_small_to` |

Multiplication is schoolbook below `KARATSUBA_MIN` (40) limbs and Karatsuba
above it, with unbalanced operands split into chunks. Division is Knuth's
Algorithm D.

**Goose specifics worth knowing:**

- Goose has no operator overloading, so the arithmetic is named functions.
- Parameters are untyped (generic), so a variable *or* a temporary binds
  by reference: `add(mul(a, b), c)` copies nothing, and the results are
  built in place at their destination.
- `x = add(x, y)` is a compile error: the new value would be built over its
  own input. Use `add_to(x, y)`, or `let t = add(x, y); x = copy(t);`.
- A `BigInt` is resizable, so it cannot be an array element and `==` does
  not apply. Use `eq`, and keep collections as limb arrays (see
  `examples/factorial.goose`).

## Layer 2: constant time

`bignum.x25519` keeps a field element in ten signed limbs, radix 2^25.5 as
in ref10, with unrolled multiply and square. The Montgomery ladder makes
255 fixed steps and swaps with masks. At the generated-C level, the field
ops, the ladder swap and `ct_eq_bytes` have no branches on secret data; the
only branches are on lengths and public counters. One X25519 takes about
85 µs in a native build (Apple Silicon, clang -O2).

`bignum.ct` holds masks, `ct_select`, `ct_cswap`, `ct_eq`, `ct_lt`,
`ct_is_zero`/`ct_is_one`, `ct_add`/`ct_sub` with carry out and their masked
forms, `ct_shr1`, `ct_cond_sub`, `ct_mod_add`/`ct_mod_sub`, `ct_mod_small` (a
number mod a public d < 2^16 by multiplying, since a division instruction's
time can follow its operands) and `ct_div_exact` (by a public odd e that
divides exactly, by multiplying with 1/e mod 2^32), all over `u32[:]` of a
public length. `bignum.mont` builds on them: `mont_mul` (CIOS), `mont_r2`
(R² mod m by doubling, so no division by a secret modulus), `ct_reduce` (a
wide number mod any m, a bit at a time), `ct_mul`, `mont_modexp`, which
uses a 4-bit window over every bit of the exponent's width and reads its
table by scanning all 16 entries, and `ct_mod_inv` (1/a mod an odd m by
Möller's constant-time binary Euclid, GMP's `mpn_sec_invert`: 64 steps per
limb whatever the values).

Every other module may call `BigInt` only on public values, and
`scripts/ct_audit.py` (run by `run_tests.py`) holds the list of the
functions that do, each with its reason; a new call fails it until it is
looked at. Variable-time helpers outside `bignum.goose` end in `_vartime`,
as Go's do.

### RSA

| Group | Functions |
|---|---|
| Keys | `rsa_generate(bits, e = 65537)` (1024 to 4096, a multiple of 64; e odd, 3 to 2^31 − 1), `rsa_key_from(n, e, d, p, q) -> key, bool`, `rsa_key_from_bytes(n, e, d, p, q)` (big-endian, as PKCS #1 holds them), `rsa_public_from(n, e) -> pub, bool` (n 1024 to 4096 bits, e odd, 3 to 2^31 − 1, as in Go), `rsa_public(key)`, `rsa_bits`, `rsa_size` |
| PKCS #1 v1.5 | `rsa_sign_pkcs1(key, msg, hash = 256) -> sig, bool`, `rsa_verify_pkcs1(pub, msg, sig, hash = 256)` |
| PSS | `rsa_sign_pss(key, msg, salt_len = -1, hash = 256) -> sig, bool`, `rsa_sign_pss_with_salt(key, msg, salt, hash = 256) -> sig, bool`, `rsa_verify_pss(pub, msg, sig, salt_len = -1, hash = 256)`; a salt_len of -1 means the hash's length |
| OAEP | `rsa_encrypt_oaep(pub, msg, label = "", hash = 256)`, `rsa_encrypt_oaep_with_seed`, `rsa_decrypt_oaep(key, ct, label = "", hash = 256) -> msg, bool`, `rsa_oaep_max(key, hash = 256)` |
| PKCS #1 v1.5 encryption | `rsa_encrypt_pkcs1(pub, msg)`, `rsa_decrypt_pkcs1(key, ct) -> msg, bool`, `rsa_decrypt_pkcs1_session_key(key, ct, key_out) -> bool` |
| Raw | `rsa_public_op(pub, x)`, `rsa_private_op(key, x) -> bytes, bool` |

`hash` is any of bignum.hmac's hash ids (SHA-256 by default), and PSS
and OAEP run MGF1 on the same hash. A key is fixed-size limb
arrays (`u32[..128]`, so at most 4096 bits), and every function that only
needs the public half accepts a private key as well. The private operation
works by CRT. It blinds its input with r^e for a random r (r and 1/r drawn
and computed in constant time), and checks the result against the public
exponent before releasing it, so a fault in one CRT half cannot leak a
prime. A result that fails the check is never released: signing then
returns false, as Go's returns an error (it also does for a key too small
for the hash, or a hash with no DigestInfo), and decryption folds the
check into its constant-time checks on the block, so a fault fails the
way a bad ciphertext does. Loading a key derives dp, dq and qinv (by
Fermat) and makes every check without branching on the numbers; only the
verdict is branched on. It then makes Go's checks that |p − q| >
2^(nbits/2 − 100) (Fermat's factoring) and d > 2^(nbits/2) (Wiener's and
Boneh-Durfee's attacks), and one private operation against the public key.
Key generation draws p = 3 mod 4 (so Miller-Rabin is one exponentiation
per round), divides by the small primes by multiplying, tests gcd(p − 1, e)
with `ct_mod_inv`, and takes d = 1/e mod (p − 1)(q − 1) through the public
e: with k = −1/φ mod e, d = (1 + kφ)/e. That is the RSA paper's d, as Go's
crypto/rsa had it before its FIPS module, which takes 1/e mod lcm(p − 1,
q − 1) in variable time instead. Only candidates that fail are branched on. PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures are verified by
rebuilding the encoding and comparing it whole. OAEP decryption checks
every field in constant time and reports one failure flag. PKCS #1 v1.5
decryption checks its padding in constant time too, but saying whether
it failed is a padding oracle (Bleichenbacher's attack). So, as in Go,
`rsa_decrypt_pkcs1_session_key` writes the key only when the padding is
good and the length right, and otherwise leaves the caller's random bytes
in place, with no difference in time or path. Use OAEP for anything new.

### DSA

`dsa_generate_parameters(l, n)` makes p, q, g for (1024, 160), (2048, 224),
(2048, 256) or (3072, 256) as Go's crypto/dsa does, and
`dsa_generate_key(p, q, g)` a key on them. `dsa_key_from(p, q, g, y, x =
"")` checks and holds big-endian parts (no x for a public key);
`dsa_public` drops x. `dsa_sign(key, digest)` uses a random nonce,
`dsa_sign_deterministic(key, digest, hash_id)` RFC 6979's, and
`dsa_verify(key, digest, sig)` checks an r ‖ s signature. Digests are cut
to q's leftmost bits, as FIPS 186 and openssl do; Go leaves that to the
caller. `dsa_sig_to_der` and `dsa_sig_from_der` convert to and from the
DER form that X.509 and openssl use. x and the nonces are drawn below q,
checked against it and used in constant time (a nonce's length leaking
over many signatures is enough to recover x, as the Minerva attacks
showed); only the public parameters go through `BigInt`.

### AES and GCM

`aes_init(key)` expands a 16-, 24- or 32-byte key. `aes_encrypt_block` and
`aes_decrypt_block` work on single blocks; `aes_ctr(k, iv, data)` is CTR
mode in place. The cipher is bitsliced, after BearSSL's `aes_ct`: eight
words hold two blocks, and the S-box is Boyar and Peralta's circuit, so no
table is indexed by data.

`aes_gcm_seal(key, nonce, aad, pt)` returns ciphertext and tag, and
`aes_gcm_open` returns the plaintext and whether the tag matched. On a
mismatch it returns nothing, and the in-place `gcm_decrypt` zeroes its
buffer. `gcm_init` / `gcm_encrypt` / `gcm_decrypt` keep the expanded key
for many messages. GHASH multiplies with integer multiplies on operands
spread into 4-bit lanes (as in BearSSL's `ghash_ctmul64`), not with tables.
Never reuse a nonce under one key. 12 bytes is the standard size; other
lengths work too. A message is at most `GCM_MAX` bytes ((2^32 − 2) · 16,
SP 800-38D): encrypting more aborts, as Go panics, and opening more fails.

`bignum.modes` has the other modes of Go's crypto/cipher, written once
over any block cipher with a `cipher_encrypt` overload (AES, DES and
triple DES here). Each works in place from a one-block IV:
- `cbc_encrypt` and `cbc_decrypt` take whole blocks;
- `cfb_encrypt` and `cfb_decrypt` (full-block segments, CFB-128 for AES),
  `ofb_xor` and `ctr_xor` take any length.

`pkcs7_pad(data, bs = 16)` and `pkcs7_unpad(data, bs) -> data, bool` add
and remove CBC padding; unpadding checks in constant time. Without a MAC
checked first, a CBC decryption that reports bad padding is still a
padding oracle, so prefer an AEAD.

`des_init(key8)` and `des3_init(key24)` expand DES and triple-DES (EDE)
keys, with `des_encrypt_block` / `des3_encrypt_block` and their decrypt
forms. The S-boxes are bit masks selected by shifts, so no table is read
at a secret index. `rc4_init(key)` and `rc4_xor(r, data)` are RC4, which
is broken and, as in Go, indexes its state by secret values.

### ChaCha20-Poly1305

`chacha20_poly1305_seal(key, nonce, aad, pt)` / `_open` and the in-place
`_encrypt` / `_decrypt`, with the same contract as GCM: 32-byte key,
12-byte nonce, 16-byte tag, nothing released on a bad tag. The pieces are
public too: `chacha20_block`, `chacha20_xor(key, counter, nonce, data)`,
and `poly1305` one-shot or streaming. A message is at most
`CHACHA20_POLY1305_MAX` bytes ((2^32 − 1) · 64, RFC 8439): encrypting more
aborts and opening more fails. `chacha20_xor` aborts, before touching the
data, if its 32-bit block counter would wrap; `chacha20_fits(counter, n)`
says whether it would. Poly1305 uses five 26-bit limbs
(after poly1305-donna-32), and its final reduction is a masked select.

`xchacha20_poly1305_seal` / `_open` (and `_encrypt` / `_decrypt`) take a
24-byte nonce, long enough to pick at random, as Go's
`chacha20poly1305.NewX`. They run ChaCha20-Poly1305 under a subkey from
`hchacha20(key, nonce[..16])`; `xchacha20_xor` is the bare stream.

### Elliptic curves

`bignum.ec` handles P-224, P-256, P-384 and P-521 with one generic
implementation. `p224()`, `p256()`, `p384()` and `p521()` return a `Curve`
holding the field prime, the group
order, their Montgomery constants and the generator; build one and pass it
to every call. Field elements are limbs of the curve's width in Montgomery
form, multiplied by `bignum.mont`. Points are projective and added with
the complete formulas of Renes, Costello and Batina for a = −3. Those have
no exceptional cases, so doubling is just an addition and the point at
infinity needs no branch. Scalar multiplication uses 4-bit windows across
the whole scalar width and reads its table by scanning every entry.

| Group | Functions |
|---|---|
| Keys | `ec_keypair(c) -> sk, pk`, `ec_public_key(c, sk)`; private keys are `len` big-endian bytes (28, 32, 48 or 66), public keys the uncompressed 04 ‖ x ‖ y |
| ECDH | `ecdh_shared(c, sk, peer) -> x, bool`: false unless the peer's point is on the curve and correctly encoded |
| ECDSA | `ecdsa_sign(c, sk, msg)`, `ecdsa_verify(c, pk, msg, sig)` with SHA-224 on P-224, SHA-256 on P-256, SHA-384 on P-384 and SHA-512 on P-521; `ecdsa_sign_digest` and `ecdsa_verify_digest` for any hash |
| DER | `ecdsa_sig_to_der(raw)`, `ecdsa_sig_from_der(c, der) -> raw, bool` (strict: minimal integers, no trailing bytes) |

ECDSA nonces come from RFC 6979's HMAC-DRBG, so signing needs no
randomness and the same input always gives the same signature.

`bignum.ed25519` reuses X25519's field code. It uses extended coordinates
with the RFC's complete addition, and reduces scalars mod L through
`bignum.mont`. Functions: `ed25519_keypair() -> seed, pk`,
`ed25519_public(seed)`, `ed25519_sign(seed, msg)`,
`ed25519_verify(pk, msg, sig)`. Verification uses the cofactored equation
[8]SB = [8]R + [8]kA. It rejects S ≥ L and non-canonical encodings of A
and R. `ed25519_sign_ctx(seed, msg, ctx)` / `ed25519_verify_ctx` are
Ed25519ctx, with a context of 1 to 255 bytes. `ed25519_sign_ph(seed,
digest, ctx = "")` / `ed25519_verify_ph` are Ed25519ph. As in Go, they
take the message's SHA-512 digest, not the message.

### ML-KEM

`mlkem_keygen(k)` gives a 64-byte seed (the private key, as in Go's
crypto/mlkem) and the encapsulation key; k is 2, 3 or 4 for ML-KEM-512,
-768 or -1024. `mlkem_encaps(k, ek) -> secret, ct, ok` refuses a malformed
ek (wrong length, or a coefficient of q or more). `mlkem_decaps(k, seed,
ct) -> secret, ok` and `mlkem_decaps_dk(k, dk, ct)` decapsulate, from the
seed or from the expanded key that `mlkem_keys_from_seed` gives. A
ciphertext that does not re-encrypt to itself yields the implicit
rejection key J(z ‖ c), selected with a mask. `mlkem_encaps_with` takes
the message, for tests. Every reduction mod q, including Compress's
division, is a multiply and a shift (the KyberSlash class of timing leaks
cannot occur).

### ML-DSA

The set is 44, 65 or 87. `mldsa_keygen(set)` gives a 32-byte seed (the
private key, as in Go's crypto/mldsa) and the public key;
`mldsa_public_key(set, seed)` recomputes it, and `mldsa_expand_key` gives
the FIPS 204 expanded private key for formats that carry it.
`mldsa_sign(set, seed, msg, ctx = "")` is hedged (fresh randomness mixed
in) and `mldsa_sign_deterministic` is not; contexts run to 255 bytes.
`mldsa_verify(set, pk, msg, sig, ctx = "")` refuses wrong lengths and any
hint encoding but the canonical one. `mldsa_mu(pk, msg, ctx)`,
`mldsa_sign_mu` and `mldsa_verify_mu` work on a precomputed message
representative, as Go's `crypto.MLDSAMu` does. Products are Montgomery
reductions with masked corrections and Decompose is a multiply and shift,
so the secret side never divides or branches on secret values; the
rejection loop's restarts are public, as the standard allows.

### HPKE

Algorithms are named by their RFC 9180 and draft-ietf-hpke-pq ids
(`HPKE_DHKEM_X25519`, `HPKE_MLKEM768_X25519`, `HPKE_HKDF_SHA256`,
`HPKE_SHAKE256`, `HPKE_AES128GCM`, `HPKE_EXPORT_ONLY`, ...), the same set
as Go's crypto/hpke plus ML-KEM-512. `hpke_keygen(kem)` and
`hpke_derive_key_pair(kem, ikm)` give a private key in the KEM's own
serialization and the public key. `hpke_sender(kem, kdf, aead, pk, info,
psk = "", psk_id = "", sk_s = "") -> enc, ctx, ok` and `hpke_recipient(kem,
kdf, aead, sk, enc, info, psk, psk_id, pk_s)` set up a context; a PSK
selects the PSK modes and a sender key the authenticated ones (DHKEM
only; the SHAKE KDFs, as in Go, run in base mode only). Then
`hpke_seal(ctx, aad, pt)`, `hpke_open` (which leaves the sequence number
alone on failure) and `hpke_export(ctx, exporter_context, n)`.
`hpke_seal_once` and `hpke_open_once` are Go's single-shot `Seal` and
`Open`: the encapsulated key followed by the ciphertext.

### Hashes, HMAC, HKDF

Every hash comes one-shot or streaming (`*_init`, `*_update`, `*_final`):
- `sha1`;
- `sha224` and `sha256`;
- `sha384`, `sha512`, `sha512_224` and `sha512_256`;
- `sha3(bits, data)`, and `shake(bits, data, n)` with `shake_read` to
  squeeze any amount;
- `cshake(bits, name, custom, data, n)` and `cshake_init`, as Go's
  `sha3.NewCSHAKE128/256`;
- `md5`;
- `blake2b(data, outlen = 64, key = "")` and `blake2s(data, outlen = 32,
  key = "")`, keyed when a key is given;
- `blake2xb(data, n, key = "")` and `blake2xs`, BLAKE2X as Go's
  `blake2b.NewXOF` and `blake2s.NewXOF`. The output length n is part of
  the hash. To stream, use `blake2xb_init(n, key)`, `blake2xb_update`,
  then `blake2xb_read(x, out) -> count` as often as needed. n = 0 means an
  unknown length, read up to 256 GiB (BLAKE2Xb) or 128 GiB (BLAKE2Xs).

The generic functions name a hash by an id: 128 (MD5), 160 (SHA-1), 224, 256, 384,
512, `HASH_SHA512_224`, `HASH_SHA512_256`, `HASH_SHA3_224` through
`HASH_SHA3_512`, and `HASH_BLAKE2B_256`, `_384`, `_512` and
`HASH_BLAKE2S_256` (Go's `crypto.BLAKE2b_256` and so on). They include
`hash_bits(id, data)`, HMAC, HKDF, PBKDF2, MGF1, RSA PSS and OAEP, and
ECDSA over a digest (`ecdsa_sign_digest`). RSA PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures
take MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2 and SHA-3 but not BLAKE2, which has no DigestInfo
(as in Go); verifying with an unsupported hash returns false. `hmac(id, key, msg)` and the `hmac_sha256/384/512` shortcuts cover HMAC.
`hkdf_extract`, `hkdf_expand` and `hkdf` cover HKDF. TLS 1.3's HKDF-Expand-Label is a
few lines on top of `hkdf_expand` and is not included.

### Go's x/crypto extras

- `md4(data)`, `ripemd160(data)`, each also streaming (`_init`,
  `_update`, `_final`).
- `salsa20_xor(key, nonce, data)`: Salsa20 for an 8-byte nonce, XSalsa20
  for a 24-byte one, in place; `hsalsa20(key, input16)`.
- NaCl: `secretbox_seal(msg, nonce, key)` (tag first, as NaCl) and
  `secretbox_open`; `box_keypair`, `box_precompute`, `box_seal(msg, nonce,
  peer_pk, sk)`, `box_open`, `box_seal_anonymous(msg, pk)` and
  `box_open_anonymous(sealed, pk, sk)`; `nacl_sign(msg, sk64)` and
  `nacl_sign_open`; `nacl_auth(msg, key)` and `nacl_auth_verify`.
- `bcrypt_hash(password, cost = 10) -> hash, ok` ("$2a$", false past 72
  bytes or for a cost above 31), `bcrypt_verify(hash, password)` (in
  constant time; $2b$ and $2y$ too) and `bcrypt_cost(hash)`;
  `bcrypt_pbkdf(password, salt, rounds, key_len) -> key, ok` (false for
  an empty password or salt, rounds below 1 or a key over 1024 bytes).
- `blowfish_init(key)`, `cast5_init(key16)`, `twofish_init(key)`,
  `tea_init(key, rounds = 64)`, `xtea_init(key)`, `rc2_init(key,
  effective_bits)`, each with `_encrypt_block` / `_decrypt_block` and
  usable with every mode.
- `xts_encrypt(k1, k2, sector, data)` and `xts_decrypt`, whole 16-byte
  blocks, as Go's x/crypto/xts.

### Password hashing and key derivation

| Function | Parameters |
|---|---|
| `argon2id_key(password, salt, t, m, p, len)` | Go's `argon2.IDKey`: t passes over m KiB with p lanes. The one to use for passwords. |
| `argon2i_key(...)` | Go's `argon2.Key` (Argon2i) |
| `argon2(kind, password, salt, secret, ad, t, m, p, len)` | `ARGON2D`, `ARGON2I` or `ARGON2ID`, with the optional secret key and associated data |
| `scrypt(password, salt, n, r, p, len) -> key, bool` | as `scrypt.Key`; false for bad parameters |
| `pbkdf2(hash, password, salt, iter, len)` | over HMAC with any hash id, as `crypto/pbkdf2` |

The lanes of Argon2 are filled one after another, which gives the same
output as running them in parallel. Argon2i, and Argon2id in the first
half of its first pass, read memory at positions that do not depend on
the password. Argon2d, Argon2id after that, and scrypt read at
password-dependent positions, as their designs intend.

### Speed

Side by side with OpenSSL 3.6.4 on an Apple M1: the Goose figures from a
native build (clang -O2), openssl's from `openssl speed -evp` over 16 KiB
buffers, PBKDF2 and scrypt through Python's hashlib (which calls OpenSSL),
and Argon2id through `openssl kdf` less its start-up time. The last column
is Goose / OpenSSL: above 1 is faster. `python3 scripts/speed_vs_openssl.py
[prefix]` rebuilds `examples/speed.goose` and prints this table afresh.

Where OpenSSL is far ahead it is mostly hardware: on this CPU it uses the
AES, PMULL (GHASH) and SHA-1/SHA-2/SHA-3 instructions, and 64-bit-limb
assembly with a 64x64->128 multiply for the curves and RSA. Goose has no
intrinsics and no wide multiply, so this library runs table-free,
constant-time AES and 32-bit limbs. OpenSSL's ML-KEM also keeps the
expanded matrix with the key, which encapsulation and decapsulation here
rebuild each time. Where neither side has special instructions (BLAKE2,
RC4, scrypt, Argon2) the two are even or Goose is ahead. RSA-2048 key
generation takes about 0.27 s on average (ten runs, in constant time).

### Caveats

- A C compiler can turn mask arithmetic back into branches, so check the
  assembly of anything that matters; `scripts/ct_timing.py` measures the
  code as built.
- The P-256/P-384 code is generic over the prime. On the same machine,
  OpenSSL's ECDH (specialized, with assembly) is 27 times faster on P-256
  and 15 times faster on P-384.
- Point compression is not supported. TLS 1.3 sends only uncompressed
  points.
- Secrets are not wiped from memory.
- `entropy` needs `getentropy` (macOS, Linux, BSDs), so it does not work on
  Windows. It opens the C library at startup (`extern "c"`, mapped to
  `libc.so.6` on Linux by `bignum.build`), so `goose run` has it too.
- This code has not been audited.

## Tests

```bash
python3 scripts/run_tests.py            # every test at -O0, -O2 and --debug, plus the examples
python3 scripts/run_tests.py --native   # also built with the C compiler
python3 scripts/ct_audit.py             # BigInt only on public values (run_tests.py runs it)
python3 scripts/ct_timing.py [scale]    # timing tests of the constant-time code (about 10 s)
python3 scripts/gen_vectors.py          # regenerate test/vectors from Python's integers
tools/govectors.sh -check test/vectors/xcrypto.txt   # xcrypto.txt against Go's x/crypto (needs Go)
tools/govectors.sh > test/vectors/xcrypto.txt   # regenerate it
```

- `bigint_vectors`: about 7,900 differential checks against Python ints,
  covering every operation. Operands include negatives, limb-boundary values
  and sizes across the Karatsuba threshold, plus divisions built to force
  Algorithm D's correction steps.
- `bigint_api`: conversion limits, in-place forms (aliased too), parse
  errors, bytes and identities.
- `ct_ops`: the constant-time helpers against `BigInt`, `ct_mod_small`,
  `ct_div_exact` and the masked forms among them.
- `timing/ct_timing` (`scripts/ct_timing.py`, not in run_tests.py): dudect's
  method (Reparaz, Balasch and Verbauwhede, 2017). Each operation runs on
  one fixed input and on random ones, interleaved at random, and Welch's
  t-test compares their times, whole and cut at percentiles; |t| above 10
  is a leak. It covers `mont_modexp` (exponent 0 against random),
  `ct_mod_inv`, `ct_mod_small`, the RSA private operation, RSA key loading,
  X25519, ECDSA on P-256 and Ed25519 signing. BigInt's `modpow` runs as a
  control and must be caught (it is, at |t| near 500; the others stay
  below 2).
- `x25519_field`: GF(2^255 − 19) arithmetic against `BigInt`, including
  non-canonical encodings.
- `x25519_rfc`: the RFC 7748 §5.2 vectors (with the 1,000-iteration chain)
  and the §6.1 key agreement.
- `x25519_vectors`: random scalars and u-coordinates against a Python
  transcription of RFC 7748.
- `mont_ops`: Montgomery multiply, exponentiation, R², reduction,
  products and `ct_mod_inv` (invertible or not) against `BigInt`.
- `sha256_vectors`: every length up to 129 bytes and longer ones, one-shot
  and in pieces, against hashlib; MGF1.
- `aes_vectors`: the S-box and its inverse on all 256 bytes, blocks at each
  key size, and CTR with counters that carry and wrap.
- `gcm_vectors`: the GCM specification's test cases 1 to 5 and random ones,
  with nonces of 12 bytes and other lengths. Every vector is also opened
  with each part tampered with in turn.
- `rsa_vectors`: PKCS #1 v1.5, PSS and OAEP under 1024-, 1025-, 1536-bit
  (e = 3) and 2048-bit keys. Outputs must match byte for byte, and changed
  inputs must be rejected.
- `hash_vectors`: SHA-384 and SHA-512 at lengths around the 128-byte block,
  one-shot and in pieces; HMAC with keys shorter and longer than a block;
  HKDF, including RFC 5869's first test case.
- `chacha20_vectors`: RFC 8439's AEAD example, then ChaCha20 and Poly1305
  (checked against openssl) with random keys, counters and lengths
  around the block size, and the AEAD opened with each part tampered with.
- `hash_vectors` also reads `hash2.txt`: SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-512/t, SHA-3
  and SHAKE (read in uneven pieces) at every length around their blocks
  and rates, and HMAC with each of them.
- `mlkem_vectors`: ML-KEM-512, -768 and -1024 keys from seeds must match
  openssl byte for byte. openssl's ciphertexts must decapsulate to its
  secrets, and changed ones to its implicit rejection keys. Malformed keys
  and ciphertexts must be refused.
- `mldsa_vectors`: ML-DSA-44, -65 and -87 against openssl
  (`scripts/parity_vectors.py`): public and expanded private keys from
  seeds, deterministic signatures under empty, short and 255-byte contexts
  reproduced byte for byte (directly and through external mu), hedged
  signatures, and changed ones that must fail, malformed hint encodings
  among them. Go's crypto/mldsa agrees with every line.
- `hpke_vectors`: RFC 9180's test vectors in all four modes (DHKEM over
  P-256, P-521 and X25519; HKDF-SHA256 and -SHA512; every AEAD and
  export-only) and Go's post-quantum ones (ML-KEM-512/768/1024, the three
  hybrids, the SHAKE KDFs, DHKEM P-384): derived key pairs, encapsulation,
  the key schedule, seals up to sequence number 256, and exports. Then
  fresh keys through every KEM, and refusals: tampered messages and
  encapsulated keys, wrong info or PSK, modes a KEM or KDF does not allow.
- `dsa_vectors`: DSA against openssl at (1024, 160), (2048, 224), (2048,
  256) and (3072, 256): RFC 6979 signatures over SHA-1 to SHA-512 digests
  (longer and shorter than q) reproduced byte for byte and through DER,
  openssl's random-nonce signatures, changed ones that must fail, and
  parameters generated here. Go's crypto/dsa agrees with every line.
- `xcrypto_vectors`: vectors from Go's x/crypto itself
  (`tools/govectors`, run offline against the module cache by
  `tools/govectors.sh`, whose `-check` compares instead): MD4 and
  RIPEMD-160 around the block boundaries, Salsa20, XSalsa20, HSalsa20,
  every NaCl construction (opened again, and refused when changed),
  bcrypt hashes recomputed from their salts (and, by `-check`, verified by
  Go's bcrypt), bcrypt_pbkdf (with
  OpenBSD's vectors) at lengths around its 32-byte blocks, Blowfish, CAST5, Twofish, TEA
  and XTEA blocks and CBC, and AES-XTS; RC2-CBC at 40, 64 and 128
  effective bits from openssl; RFC 2268's RC2 and RFC 2144's CAST-128
  vectors.
- `ec_vectors`: P-256, P-384 and P-521 multiples of the generator (1, 2, n − 2,
  n − 1 and random ones), ECDH, and ECDSA matching RFC 6979 byte for byte.
  Signatures also go through DER and back. Off-curve points, bad
  encodings, out-of-range scalars, r = 0, s = n and non-minimal DER are
  all rejected.
- `ed25519_vectors`: RFC 8032's tests 1 to 3 and random ones, matching
  byte for byte. Changed messages, signatures and keys are rejected, as
  are S ≥ L and non-canonical or off-curve keys.
- `rsa_api`: generated keys, key loading checks, raw operation bounds,
  signatures and ciphertexts under the wrong key.
- `ec_vectors` also reads `ec224.txt`: P-224 the same way, with RFC 6979's
  P-224 signature.
- `modes_vectors`: CBC, CFB, OFB and CTR over AES (each key size), DES and
  triple DES, at lengths around the block, each way. Also single DES and
  triple-DES blocks (with the textbook vector), MD5 and HMAC-MD5, RC4 with
  keys of 1 to 256 bytes, and PKCS #7 padding with every malformed variant
  refused. All of it is checked against openssl.
- `kdf_vectors`: BLAKE2b and BLAKE2s (keyed and not, every output length,
  in pieces) and PBKDF2 over each hash family, against hashlib; scrypt
  with RFC 7914's cases; Argon2d, Argon2i and Argon2id. The Argon2 cases
  include RFC 9106's vectors and ones from openssl with 1 to 4 lanes and
  memory past an address block.
- `extra_vectors`: XChaCha20-Poly1305 (the draft's vectors), cSHAKE (SP
  800-185's samples), Ed25519ctx and Ed25519ph (RFC 8032 §7.2 and §7.3,
  and openssl). On one 2048-bit key: OAEP over SHA-1, SHA-2 and SHA-3,
  and PKCS #1 v1.5 encryption, including openssl's own ciphertexts, with
  malformed padding refused and the session-key form left untouched.
- `blake2_vectors`: BLAKE2Xb and BLAKE2Xs, with the reference KATs at
  every length from 1 to 256 and random ones, both one-shot and read in
  uneven pieces. HMAC, HKDF and PBKDF2 over each BLAKE2 id; RSA-PSS over
  BLAKE2, and PKCS #1 v1.5 over MD5 (checked by openssl). Go's x/crypto
  and crypto/* agreed with every line when the file was made. Also
  ECDSA over BLAKE2 digests.

`scripts/crypto_vectors.py` holds the Python transcriptions behind the
AES, GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, RSA, EC and Ed25519 vectors (hashes, HMAC and HKDF come from
hashlib). Each transcription is first checked against its standard's
published vectors. Then, while generating, every AES, CTR, ChaCha20,
Poly1305, RSA, ECDH, ECDSA and Ed25519 vector is also checked with the `openssl` command when
it is installed. `scripts/extra_vectors.py` does the same for everything
added later (with `des_ref.py`, a DES transcription). It checks cSHAKE's
transcription through openssl's KMAC, which is built on it. Its Argon2
cases and openssl's own PKCS #1 v1.5 ciphertexts come from openssl
itself, so they change when regenerated.

The compiler is found from `--goose`, then `$GOOSE`, then `goose` on PATH,
then `../goose.git/build/goose`.
